Initial Ideas:
	Worldwide skills
		1. Flash
		2. Heal
		3. Ghost
		4. Cleanse
		5. Smokescreen (AOE Slow) 
		
	Main 5 classes:
		1. Warrior	(Ooga booga sword)
		2. Bowman	(Typical archer)
		3. Thief	(Sneaky, Glass cannon assassin shadower + some dots and tiny bit of range)
		4. Mage		(Typical Mage)
		5. Pirate	(All-around bruiser, mix of range and melee)
		
	General inputs:
		Passives? 
		Q - Attack
		X - Attack
		E - Attack
		R - Ultimate
		C - Cancel casting
		Left click - Basic attack
		Right click - Attack
		D - Worldwide skill
		F - Worldwide skill
		Space - Jump? Movement ability? Unsure (Y axis spooky)
		
	Directory Structure:
		Main -
			|-> Characters
			|		|->	Warrior
			|		|-> Bowman
			|		|-> Thief
			|		|-> Mage
			|		|-> Pirate
			|		|-> Subclasses (Maybe future? Job advancements)
			|-> Art
				|-> Characters
						|-> Warrior
								|-> Skins
								|-> Animations
								|-> Sprites
								|-> etc
						|-> Same pattern for rest
			

For Code:
	Have a ICharacter interface showing what functionality is expected from all characters
		Properties everyone should have, this will be defined in constructor:
			- AD
			- Movespeed
			- Attack speed
			- HP
			- MP
			- Eventually: Resistances? Maybe just Defense > Armor/MR since only 1 mage class.
	Character parent class that contains implementation of interface.
		Will have a virtual function for QWERDFC implementations. Thinking everything will just be basic attacks be default.
	Then specifics:
		Warrior inherits Character, and overrides functionalities in QWERDFC
